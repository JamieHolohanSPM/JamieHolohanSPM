<h2 dir="ltr" id="ii4">Background</h2>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>**Note**:&nbsp;</strong>From here on in, I use the terms focusable field/element or editable field/element. The difference between the two is, a focusable field is any field that the util.doSetFocus() function determines to be the focusField. An editable field, is a focusable field that requires Forms Mode to be enabled. But there are certain field types that require user interaction, but do not trigger Forms Mode. Examples of these are checkboxes and&nbsp;radio buttons, All editable fields are focusable fields. Not all focusable fields are editable fields. Below I've listed some examples of these:<br />
<br />
<u>Focusable field</u>: Text input field, dropdown widget, a select, a radio button, a checkbox, an anchor element, a text area, a Browse button<br />
<u>Editable field</u>: Text input field, dropdown widget, a select, a text area</p>

<p dir="ltr"><br />
A support ticket was raised by MCSS in relation to forms mode not being triggered for the first editable field for&nbsp;JAWS users in IE11 when a page has loaded. JAWS has the automatic forms mode setting switched on by default, so usually when an editable field receives focus (through tabbing/using JAWS virtual cursor) forms mode would be triggered, which would allow the user to interact with the field. For example, they may type into the field, or expand a drop down menu.<br />
But in Curam, when the page loaded and the first focusable element was an editable field, forms mode was not being automatically triggered and therefore users were not able to interact with the field initially.<br />
A fix for this was put into 7.0.5.0 as part of&nbsp;<a href="https://jazz031.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/SPM#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=225885">https://jazz031.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/SPM#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=225885</a>.<br />
The fix was to include a one second delay in setting the focus in IE11 when a page had loaded. This almost consistently (though not 100% of the time) triggered forms mode for JAWS users.<br />
<br />
Since this fix was added to the codebase, a number of issues related to the change have been raised. For example:<br />
<a href="https://jazz031.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/SPM#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=255274">https://jazz031.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/SPM#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=255274</a>&nbsp;was raised as if a user began typing in another field, the focus would jump back to the first focusable field after one second. This was addressed by detecting if the user had focused on another field, and if so, refrain from setting the focus on the default focusable field.<br />
<a href="https://jazz031.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/L2%20Support#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=258299">https://jazz031.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/L2%20Support#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=258299</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://jazz031.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/L2%20Support#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=259828">https://jazz031.hursley.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/L2%20Support#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&amp;id=259828</a>&nbsp;were raised as if a user began to scroll immediately after the page loaded, when the first focusable element was focused, the page would jump back towards the top of the page. This was interrupting the user's scrolling and causing frustration for customers.<br />
<br />
A TestFix (7.0.7.0_iFix5_TestFix_260301) was given to MSD to address the scrolling issues, where the position of the page was stored before setting focus and then immediately after setting focus it would scroll to that point. The customer was not satisfied with this fix as they said it did not work for modal/popup pages and for non-modal pages in IE11, there was a noticeable flicker after the focus had been set.<br />
<br />
It was decided that the 1 second delay in focus should be removed for IE11 as it was causing a number of usability issues for all users.<br />
This design page details in the investigation that was carried out in order to try find an alternative solution for triggering forms mode automatically in IE11 after a page has loaded and a field receives focus.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" id="ii9">Design</h3>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Design 1:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The one second delay in setting the focus in IE11 will be removed from the product. This has caused a number of issues since it was introduced and it's removal will boost the usability performance of the product in IE11.<br />
It was originally added to address an issue where Forms Mode was not triggered for JAWS users when a page loaded. An alternative solution is needed to address this.<br />
The scrolling issues MSD reported were caused by the significant amount of time it took before a field received focus, Users were able to scroll down the page before this one second threshold, and when the focusable field received focus, the page would move from the current position to the position of the focused element.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>JAWS forms mode related:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Perform the above tests with JAWS enabled. If forms mode is not triggered automatically on the focused editable field after the page has loaded, press TAB and SHIFT-TAB in order to trigger forms mode.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Scenarios that Satya has noted where JAWS doesn't switch to forms mode automatically in most cases after removal of 1 second delay:</strong></p>

<ol data-indent="0" data-stringify-type="ordered-list" dir="ltr">
	<li>Person Tab - Administration tab — Roles — click on Register in New Role link,&nbsp;select new Role ( ex: Information provider) in Participant Role combobox on Register Participant Role.Test dialog and on press Enter on Next button, focus is on Reference field but JAWS not switching to forms mode</li>
	<li>Person Tab - Administration tab — Duplicates — click on Mark New Duplicate link,&nbsp;search for a person on Duplicate Person Search dialog, select the User on Duplicate Person Search dialog and on press Enter on Next button, focus is on Reason combobox but JAWS not switching to forms mode</li>
	<li>Create a new Intake and add Participant and from Tab Actions menu click on Open Intake. From Tab Actions menu select Update Narrative, focus goes to CK Editor but JAWS not switching to forms mode.</li>
	<li>Create a new Intake and add Participant and from Tab Actions menu click on Open Intake. Go to Administration tab -&gt; User Roles and click on New Supervisor link to open New Supervisor dialog. Click on Search icon to open User Search dialog, focus goes to First Name text field in User Search dialog&nbsp;but JAWS not switching to forms mode.</li>
	<li>Insurance Affordability AC/IC. Go to Evidence dashboard and Open New Income modal fill in details and click on Save &amp; New button.. JAWS not switching to Forms mode after latest fix..</li>
	<li>On any Search Page (ex: Person Search) after clicking on Reset button focus goes back to Reference field but JAWS not switching to Forms mode</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr">I have tested the above scenarios and they work most of the time on my VM, using the same docker image as Satya. This is an example of the inconsistencies that JAWS presents when switching to Forms Mode.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="ii15">Implementation Notes</h2>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>General thoughts:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Triggering Forms Mode is out of our control. We have no control overs JAWS, we can only "entice it" to behave in the expected manner.<br />
I tried many different types of solutions in order to address this issue but none work as well as the one second delay. In my opinion, I believe the 1 second delay only works almost consistently (but not 100% of the time) because it is such a large threshold, that after 1 second all processing on the page (DOM, JS related etc) has finished or has been significantly reduced, and in that time JAWS has finished analysing the page. Then when the focus is placed, JAWS detects this and Forms Mode is triggered. At certain times the&nbsp;JAWS virtual cursor remains on the previously clicked element, even after a new page has loaded and the first editable field has received focus. These elements are read out correctly, but not interactive. This happened seldomly with the 1 second delay, but happens more consistently without it. I don't think we can get this working 100% of the time.<br />
All IE11 focus related changes should be removed once support for IE11 is dropped!!</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Removing 1 second delay:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">I originally planned on removing it completely, and all fixes that were put into the product to address issues with the 1 second delay.<br />
After numerous hours of testing on my own VM, on multiple streams, docker images, and sending it to Satya for early testing, it was decided that a delay was required as JAWS was acting too inconsistently.<br />
Therefore I restored the timeouts and any changes that were put in place to address the issues with the 1 second delay (such as don't auto set focus if user has manually places the focus elsewhere)<br />
<br />
There are now different thresholds set&nbsp;when focusing on certain types of fields.<br />
<br />
<u>Modals:</u><br />
Any editable field within a modal will receive focus in 200ms<br />
Any field that doesn't require Forms mode will receive focus instantly.<br />
Any textarea will receive focus in 1 second as any threshold below 1 second did not work. Satya and I could not think of any use case where there is a textarea as the first element and where that page has a scroll bar.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><u>Non-Modals:</u><br />
Any editable field within a modal will receive focus in 500ms<br />
Any field that doesn't require Forms mode will receive focus instantly.<br />
Any textarea will receive focus in 1 second as any threshold below 1 second did not work. Satya and I could not think of any use case where there is a textarea as the first element and where that page has a scroll bar.<br />
<br />
<strong>Hidden input field:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">A hidden input field is created and focused on immediately when the first focusable field is an editable field. This helps JAWS trigger forms mode from our experience in testing.<br />
This logic exists in both ModalDialog._setFocusHandler() and util.setFocus()<br />
Once the onblur event is triggered on this field (when focus&nbsp;leaves the element), this field is destroyed. For extra safety, this field is created outside of the form incase there are use cases where the page is reloaded as soon as it loads (An example of this can be seen when creating New Evidence on a IC. There is custom JS in for the Evidence_NewEvidence.uim page that reloads the page as soon as it loads as it populates a list of evidences. The dropdown on this page also has an onchange event linked to it that will reload the page when a new value is selected)<br />
This hidden input field is visually hidden using inline stylings and also has an aria-hidden and no labels in order to prevent it from being announced by JAWS.<br />
<br />
To visually hide an element, I used the following stylings:<br />
position: absolute; height: 1px; width: 1px; overflow: hidden; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px); white-space: nowrap;<br />
<br />
<strong>Styling changes:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The styling changes applied as part of this fix appear to be key in getting JAWS to trigger forms mode. Before they were applied, anything threshold below 1 second did not work at all in my experience.<br />
The styling changes for modals and tab navigation involve using opacity: 0 as opposed to visibility: hidden.<br />
I discovered this&nbsp;after creating a custom webpage (I was trying to determine if it was a JAWS defect after seeing&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues/167?">https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues/167?</a> or if our HTML structure was invalid)&nbsp;which simulated opening a modal (I kept the same HTML structure as we have in Curam and used timeouts to simulate long page loading times). JAWS triggered forms mode consistently there even when there were no timeouts in setting focus.<br />
I then installed a browser plugin into IE11 which disabled all styling, both inline and CSS. I noticed that Forms Mode was triggered in the Tab Test in the use cases I tried (again with no timeouts), but as soon as styling was re-added, it no longer worked. For modals, I eventually narrowed it down to the visibility:hidden styling&nbsp;being applied and that it was being constructed 10000px off screen. Removing these stylings addressed the issues with modals. I applied a similar fix to Tab navigation.<br />
Unfortunately it wasn't the silver bullet as although JAWS triggered Forms Mode in a lot of cases, it didn't work as consistent as before.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Changes to popups:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">I noticed that after all other changes had been applied, there were still issues with Forms Mode when opening modals from popup menus. I noticed this is where JAWS acted most inconsistently even with the 1 second delay.<br />
I noticed that once a menu item is clicked, the menu is hidden using inline "display:none" styling, but the JAWS virtual cursor appeared to stay on the menu item. As a test, I updated the popup.js in the dojo-overrides package, to not hide the menu at all and from then on JAWS switched to Forms Mode consistently. I then decided to visually hide the menu instead of using "display:none" and this helped JAWS with switching to Forms Mode. But I discovered issues while testing, as although visually hidden, users could still potentially navigate to the hidden menu with JAWS or with the TAB button (setting the tabIndex to -1 was problematic). So I added some logic, where if the menu is not re-opened after 200ms, then the original "display:none" styling is applied to it. If it is reopened, within 200ms, then the stylings that visually hide the menu are removed.<br />
I was reluctant to make this change as it needed to take place in the popup.js file in the dojo-overrides package. Since it is a dojo-override, it is used not only by Curam code but also by dojo code too.<br />
I made sure that these changes only happen&nbsp;in IE11 in order to narrow any potential impact.</p>

<p dir="ltr">To visually hide an element, I used the following stylings:<br />
position: absolute; height: 1px; width: 1px; overflow: hidden; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px); white-space: nowrap;<br />
<br />
<strong>Note on IEG:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">I investigated whether IEG was affected by the focus timeout changes in IE11. IEG has it's own javascript class that sets the focus on it's form fields, so it does not require any changes. IEG also has a timeout for setting focus and it sets the focus on element after 250ms.<br />
The IEG focus javascript class is:&nbsp;/BIZINF/webclient/components/IntelligentEvidenceGathering/jscript/src/ieg/ieg-focus.js</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>CKEditor:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">CKEditor/Rich&nbsp;text editors are rendered differently to the rest of our form elements. They are first rendered as textareas and then the RTE is rendered in place of that text area. The RTE is not rendered by the time the focus functions are called in order to set focus dynamically.&nbsp;The CKEditor code is responsible for setting the focus within the RTE. If the RTE is the first/only focusable element on the page, a flag can be passed in&nbsp;the UIM to set the focus on this element.<br />
Screens where the RTE is the first focusable element may have issues with JAWS entering forms mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>New Evidence (IC) and Transfer Evidence UIM screens:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">There were additional scrolling issues with the New Evidence (IC) and Transfer Evidence modal UIM screens. This was due to these screens having custom JS applied where the page is re-loaded as soon as it first loads in order to populate a list. There is also an onchange eventlistener added to the combo box on the page, so if a new value is selected, the page will reload. This caused scrolling issues as users could select a new value and then scroll before the page had fully re-loaded and before the focus had been set after 200ms. The only way to address this was to suppress the focus delay completely for these modals. To do this, in the custom JS for the pages, I set a property in the sessionStorage called "suppressCuramModalFocusTimeout" to "true". Then in the ModalDialog.js, before setting the focus by calling curam.util.setFocusOnField(focusField, isModal, localizedModalFrameTitle), I check to see if this flag has been set. If it is set, I then suppress the timeout. After the focus has been set, this flag is then removed.<br />
An additional change needed to be added to the custom JS where the form is submitted,&nbsp;This change involved wrapping the submit function in a timeout with 0ms threshold. This was done because when I tried setting the&nbsp;suppressCuramModalFocusTimeout flag and didn't have the timeout, I was getting a JS error saying that I couldn't "execute the code from a freed script". This usually occurs when you call a function that was created in a window or frame that no longer exists. So I believe this was happening in the custom JS because when setting a property in the sessionstorage, that property is going to be available globally and not just within the scope of the current frame. But as the page is submitted immediately after loading and therefore the frame is re-loaded, the function to set the property in the sessionstorage was not fully completed. So by setting a timeout of 0ms on the submit function, this adds that function to the end of the event queue and allows for the sessionstorage property to be set properly. This does not appear to have any impact on the functionality or UX of the page.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Other solutions that were attempted:</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The following is a list of alternative solutions that were attempted but were not successful. A lot of the time these were shots in the dark:<br />
<br />
Using setActive(); -&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/Chrome/API/Browser_API/setActive">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/Chrome/API/Browser_API/setActive</a><br />
An onscroll listener which did not set the focus if a user had scrolled.<br />
Scroll back to the user's position when the field is focused.<br />
Varying levels of timeout thresholds for setting the focus (when there were no styling changes applied)<br />
Using HTML autofocus attribute.<br />
Using JS topics to set the focus at a later point.<br />
Detecting if the readystate of the iframe is loaded/complete and then set the focus.<br />
Running util.setFocus()/ModalDialog._setFocusHandler() as part of the onload event when an iframe has loaded.<br />
Setting focus on a non-input field (e.g hidden span)&nbsp;before focussing on the focusable field.<br />
Adding timeout delay to setFocus() and _setFocusHandler() functions themselves.<br />
Calling setFocus() when&nbsp;various topics which are published during the loading of a page (e.g when an iframe is loaded, displayed, within a postiframeloadhandler function). I tried in multiple places&nbsp;throughtout the JS code. Examples of such topics which I tried to leverage are "/curam/application/tab/revealed", "curam/tab/contextRefresh", "/curam/main-content/page/loaded"<br />
Calling .click() on the focusField.<br />
Emitting an event which simulated pressing "ENTER" or "SPACE" on the field in order to try trigger Forms Mode.<br />
Editing various roles and aria-roles on HTML elements in case they were being used incorrectly.<br />
Try see was it a JAWS defect. I saw a similar defect raised with them,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues/167?">https://github.com/FreedomScientific/VFO-standards-support/issues/167?</a>, but as I was unable to reproduce the error in a custom webapge with our HTML structure, I did not raise a defect with JAWS.<br />
Removing the curam.util.setFocus() javascript from forms within gen-jsp.xsl and manually call the function using a topic.</p>
