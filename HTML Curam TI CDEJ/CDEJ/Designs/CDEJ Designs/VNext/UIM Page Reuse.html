<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Background</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The new Adult Protective Services (APS) solution is being built by re-using many of the components which are already present in the existing Child Services solution (CCS). The design of the new solution has highlighted that many of the existing screens already present in the CCS solution could be reused for APS. The caveat here is that the server side processing which results from the actions from these pages is different between the two solutions so although the screens may display the same/similar information, the actions taken may be different. Therefore, this is a possible need to provide some context to these "generic" pages to allow the pages to be reused but the context of where the pages were called from to be passed to the server logic that processes the resultant data.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Requirements</span></strong></p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>TEC-XXXXX - Title of ticket</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Q&amp;A</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">This is <strong>optional</strong>. There may be some outstanding questions as regards to the requirements. These questions and the answers when they become available may be recorded here.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Non Functional Requirements</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. We can fill in N/A if the specified non functional requirement is not applicable to the feature being delivered, otherwise some notes must be entered here covering the particular area.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<table border="1" dir="ltr" height="263" width="671">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;"><strong>NFR</strong></td>
			<td style="width: 537px;"><strong>Note&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Accessibility</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to be used by people with disabilities. When new technologies are being used for the UI very careful consideration should be given to whether screen readers can be used with the technologies. This applies specifically to usage of JavaScript, Flex and SVG. The use of colors to provide functionality should be considered (and avoided), along with resolutions that will be used by vision impaired users.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Availability &amp; Resilience</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to be fully or partly operational as and when required and to effectively handle failures that could affect system availability. This should be considered when working outside of the normal infrastructure and deployment. For example, the XML Server is not deployed in an application server and has special handling for fail-over and load balancing. Careful consideration should be taken before adding new components, e.g. EJB Beans, MDBs, to the infrastructure.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Development Resource</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to be designed, built, deployed and operated within known constraints of people, budget, time, etc. In general there is not much information required here, however where special skill sets or people with siloed knowledge are required to work on the change/enhancement, this should be detailed here.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Evolution</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to be flexible in the face of the inevitable change that all systems experience after deployment, balanced against the costs of providing such flexibility. Consideration should be given to future proofing the change, including considering how to upgrade to any changes or enhancements provided in the future. Specifically designs should accommodate elements such as localisation (text, dates, etc.), customization, configurability, and componentization. Providing these features in future releases, when not considered up front, has caused impacts for customers in the past and has prevented us from providing the features in some cases.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Internationalisation</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to be independent from any particular language, country or cultural group. Localisation and internationalisation are a large concern for Cúram. Support should always be provided to view information in multiple locales, based on the user and server locale, along with support for working in multiple time zones.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Location</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to overcome problems brought about by the absolute location of its elements and the distances between them. For the most part this is not a major concern, however we should never design based on the assumption that the customer will use a default configuration</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Performance and Scalability</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to predictably execute within its mandated performance profile and to handle increased processing volumes. Performance and scalability are a concern and should always be considered during design. Where necessary, the Performance and Benchmarking teaming should be engaged early to help with determining impact of potential changes.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Regulation</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to conform to locale and international laws, quasi-legal regulations, company policies and other rules and standards. Regulation includes the usages of third party tools and the licensing issues associated with these. New jars should never be introduced without considering the legal implications and licensing of the jars. This includes usage of GPL licensed code. Also, usage of code freely provided on the web and not properly licensed should be avoided.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Security</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ability of the system to reliably control, monitor and audit who can perform what actions on what resources and to detect and recover from failures in security mechanisms. This is a concern where new features are added that are not contained within the normal Cúram security.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 118px;">Usability</td>
			<td style="width: 537px;">The ease with which people who interact with the system can work effectively. How the change will affect the user and how they use the application/feature should always be considered. Where necessary the business analysts and our user interface experts should be engaged early to ensure we meet usability requirements. e.g. printing.</td>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Design Options</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Option 1</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">Reuse the existing "resolve page" functionality to place resolve pages between the parent pages and the child page (which is common) and pass the context through via this mechanism.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Option 2</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">Optional Page Parameters, allow the parent pages to connect to the child page. The child page would contain "x" amount of page parameters but the parent page is not obliged to pass all of those page parameters through (i.e. optional page parameters). In this way, the pages could be reused and called from a variety of different places. Would these page parameters have to be explicitly marked as "optional"?</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Option 3</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">Dynamic Links.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Option 4</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">Page Renderer</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Design</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. This should outline in detail the design chosen with all of the various areas for the component covered.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">UML Diagram/Class Architecture Diagram/Schematic Architecture Diagram</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">If applicable, a diagram should be constructed and placed here to display to the reader at a glance the architecture of the new feature or at the very least the relationship between the various classes that make up the new feature. It may also be applicable to construct a schematic to highlight the feature within the overall product that the feature is being applied to (i.e. where does this new feature fit into the overall offering etc.)</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">This will differ from component to component so the sub headings here will reflect that.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Component A</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Component B</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Validations</span></strong></p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Validations Required</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Data Model Changes and Required Indexes</span></strong></p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Describe any changes required to the data model, entities, operations, indexes etc.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Also important here that if new tables/indexes are being added, check to ensure that the primary key/index lenght does not exceed the maximum allowed for DB2</strong></li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Resilience</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. Some thought should be given to how resilient the new feature is.</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens if something expected/unexpected goes wrong?</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens to the system?</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the user be able to take corrective action in the system without the need to resort to application logs/SQL searching/data manipulation outside of the system.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the data be left in a consistent state within the system after the exception is thrown?</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will there be messages given to the user? What will these messages be?</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will there something written to the logs? What will this be?</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the feature require some of the exception data to be captured and an admin function provided to allow the situation to be re-mediated?</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Q &amp; A</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">This is <strong>optional</strong>. There may be some outstanding questions as regards to the design. These questions and the answers when they become available may be recorded here.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Use Cases</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. The various use cases for the feature must be outlined here. They can be in whatever format deemed appropriate (i.e. verbose description or in a tabular format with actors and actions etc.). Below is an example of how use cases may be documented in a tabular format.</p>

<table border="1" dir="ltr" style="width: 638px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Role/Actor</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Expected Behavior</strong></td>
			<td style="width: 256px;"><strong>Tested</strong></td>

			<td>User</td>
			<td>Does Something</td>
			<td>What happens when this action is taken?</td>
			<td style="width: 256px;">How is this tested, manual or automatically?</td>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Implementation Notes</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>optional</strong>. Any notes related to the actual implementation can be described here. These can be related to some questions related to the implementation, the way some part of the implementation was completed etc.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Application Impact</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. If there is no impact, then this is as simple as saying so. If there is impact, then this may describe the impact in detail and outline the upgrade path. If the feature is related to a CLE, this section can be a link to that CLE (and hence the documentation associated with the CLE will suffice).</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">CTM</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>optional</strong>. Consideration should be given to whether this feature adds or changes administration data. If new administration data is being added, are new CTM business objects required to transport this data. If existing administration data is being modified, will this require changes to existing CTM BOM instances?</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">JMX</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>optional</strong>. Consideration should be given to whether this feature should be instrumented to add JMX metrics. Normally, this is applicable to larger features and at the infrastructure level, there are few places where this is required. Nonetheless, some thought should be given to this item during the design phase.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Testing</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. An outline of all of the testing required by the feature should be present here. This may tie in with the use cases outlined above. This may differ from component to component so the sub headings here will reflect that.</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>
	<p>Unit tests</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Manual Test Plans</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Automated tests</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Documentation/How To Use Feature</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. This should describe how to use the feature added. Again this may differ from component to component but there are some general headings to consider:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>
	<p>Where the feature fits in the overall component?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>How it may be accessed (i.e. created/authored)?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>What does it do (may be linked to the use cases above)?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Advantages of using the feature?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Any limitations associated with the feature?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A description of how the feature should be used etc.? This may also include a description of a contract between the various teams using the feature and will incorporate some details of the design.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Check List</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. Basically this is a quick check list of items that should be considered when doing a design for that particular component.</p>

<table border="1" dir="ltr" style="width: 658px;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 166px;"><strong>Check List Item</strong></td>
			<td style="width: 314px;"><strong>Notes</strong></td>
			<td style="width: 157px;"><strong>Considered Yes/No/NA</strong></td>
		</tr>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Work Estimation</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">This is <strong>mandatory</strong>. Again, the actual items listed in the estimate breakdown may vary from task to task and component to component.</p>
