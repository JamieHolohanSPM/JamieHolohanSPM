<p dir="ltr">Meeting Minutes...</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>The conversations with NC are they they want PD to consider a wider "data loss" business problem. They mentioned specific areas (Contact Log, Notes, IEG) but they think this is a more general/wider problem than that.</li>
	<li>What Stephen is investigating and will continue to elaborate on is a solution that could possible provide underlying infrastructure that would be applicable for general data loss problem. This incorporates the auto-save as per option presented to NC plus saving of some state information as per NC's soln.</li>
	<li>Where this infrastructure is applied in the product will be based on where the biggest need(s) exists; we are aware of Contact Log and Notes problem areas so further research is required to understand if/where else this exists in the product - this was the research I was referring to that Des would look in to.
	<ul>
		<li>IEG is one potential area not currently on our radar - so get the scenario from Kieran, understand does this really represent a potential or significant problem to users for loss of data</li>
		<li>Are there other wizards in the application where out-of-the-box that might represent a data-loss problem (again only ones that are a real/significant problem)</li>
		<li>Where else do we use RTF? Does this usage represent a place where a user could be entering lots of information which therefore could be lost (as per notes/contact log)</li>
		<li>Anything else that you can think of / find representing possibility for data loss for users</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Once we have a better understanding from your research Des, this will feed into Stephen's technical analysis on a generic solution - i.e. is there anything beyond what we know about already (contact log and notes) that we feel would also need to be supported by the generic solution?<br />
	Note - we can decide not to include these in the product, could the customer use the generic APIs or infrastructure we provide to do it themselves.</li>
	<li>Once we know the widest possible scope of generic solution (infrastructure/APIs - don't know what to call this!), we can then decide how to set boundaries on it.<br />
	For example can it support wizards in general, how would customers include one of their own wizards, could customers save any page, if IEG out of scope - describe alternative approach we provide for it..... Again, we can decide that certain area's in product could risk loss of data which we will not support but better that we make a conscious decision about this, with our rationale for why not (for example - perhaps its just too different and a different/separate solution required, so we'd add that to the backlog).</li>
	<li>This is all to feed into the revised Hills statements for what we think we should do here. From our discussions, there may not be other areas to add for consideration but the research is really to clarify that's a correct statement.<br />
	Personally I feel we would have two functional hills for Contact Log and Notes Auto-Save plus resume capabilities. Both of these underpinned by a technical foundation that would provide a generic solution but we can decide if we want to state a third hill to cater for the 'generic aspect' of the infrastructure.</li>
